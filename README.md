Gradient domain is used instead of intensity of pixels in image cloning to blend two images by solving Poisson equations with a predefined boundary condition. Based on this idea, there are two options:
1- Seamless cloning
2- Mixing gradients
For more information read Readme.pdf

### Get Started

1- Open Demo.m

2- Change the filenames accordingly; in the current demo we assume the source, target, and result images have the following filenames:
```
source='source_image.jpg';
target='target_image.jpg';
result='result_image.jpg';
```
3- Run Demo.m
